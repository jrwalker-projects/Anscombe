"# Anscombe" 
Worked (derivative) example using the Anscombe dataset to illustrate the importance of visual inspecation of data.
Summary statistics of the sets match: mean x&y, sample variance x&y plus the correlation of x&y
We fit linear models to see that those match as well - slope as well as intercept

But looking at the data in a plot it's clear the data sets are quite different
